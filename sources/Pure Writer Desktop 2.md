> v1.9.0 is not the latest version, but it is fully functional. The following **v2.0 version** is a beta version and a work in progress.

#### v2.2.3 Beta

> Finally, once again, Nice to see you.
>
> What you see before you is the all-new Pure Writer Desktop.
>
> The all-new Pure Writer Desktop is an enormous project, one that would take at least five years to fully complete. The client we are releasing today is essentially a half-finished product. **Currently, it only supports some of the most basic features, along with cloud backup and Cloud synchronization ‚Äî cloud sync only works with OneDrive for now.** Many features and UI elements have yet to be implemented or are in their initial stages, and a lot of details still need refinement and adjustment‚Ä¶
>
> Because many users were eagerly looking forward to it, we decided to release it even though it is far from a fully mature version. This is a good starting point, and it is already more advanced and richer than the first release of Pure Writer for Android back in 2017.
>
> The road ahead is long, difficult, and winding, but we have not given up. We believe that one day we will reach that satisfying and groundbreaking milestone. Until then, the all-new Pure Writer Desktop will remain completely free for an extended period.
>
> We hope you can find joy in some of the details and offer us your understanding and patience as we continue our relentless efforts. Your support will be greatly appreciated.
>
> The current version may have many shortcomings and issues, so we ask for your patience and understanding!

Please be assured and simply add the desktop installer and the installed files (`C:\Program Files\Pure Writer 2`) to the whitelist.
