Peace of Mind

The icon of Pure Writer is a projection of a time machine, implying that words can take us through time and space, and also corresponds to the "history record" and "automatic backup" features specially provided by Pure Writer. With these protections, even if you accidentally delete the text, or your phone suddenly loses power and shuts down, your article can still be completely saved or found in the history record. Over the years, Pure Writer has provided a reassuring, secure writing experience, achieving the rare feat of no loss, and has been widely praised.

Smooth and Fluid

In addition to achieving the most important security guarantee, the UI interface and various writing aids of Pure Writer can also make users feel that this application is really pleasing to the eye and smooth. Pure Writer has adapted the soft keyboard interface of Android 11, allowing your fingers to smoothly control the rise and fall of the soft keyboard. At the same time, it also provides a breathing cursor, the cursor is no longer just flashing, but like human breathing, gradually fading in and out. Many such details, Pure Writer has polished to the extreme, while it has many writing aids, such as "automatically completing paired symbols", deleting paired symbols when pressing delete, pressing the enter key to jump out of the quotation range when completing dialogue content... Many such aids will feel timely and natural, when you compare with other editor applications, you will find Pure Writer does it better, smoother, and more meticulous.

Simplicity in Complexity

Many basic features that an editor should have, Pure Writer has not missed, such as quick input bar, <b>multi-device cloud sync</b>, paragraph indentation, paragraph spacing, generating beautiful long images, undo, word count, dual editor side by side, one-click format adjustment, find and replace, Markdown, computer version... and some very creative features, such as: using the TTS voice engine to read out the text you input in real time, helping you check in a different sensory way whether the input text is correct. For example, it has achieved "unlimited word count", as long as your phone's performance allows, there is no word limit. Even so, Pure Writer still maintains a minimalist design style, follows Material Design, and is both useful and beautiful.

You can reach the inspiration page at super fast speed, and you can interrupt and continue writing anytime, anywhere. Pure Writer has done all this for you. A reassuring and smooth writing experience, this is Pure Writer, please enjoy writing!
