> Pure Writer Desktop is currently basic, providing only two-directions real-time synchronous editing for your current article. **If you are going to pay _JUST_ for this Desktop, I strongly recommend that you reconsider it.**

#### So far, Pure Writer Desktop has some known issues, please be sure to read them all:

- Pure Writer Desktop 1.3.3 version must be used with Pure Writer 19.4.2 or above

- Pure Writer Desktop must be **on the same Wi-Fi or hotspot network** as the phone to connect to each other

- During the development of this desktop version, I have encountered some situations that will cause the current article on Pure Writer Android to be emptied. Although this problem has been fixed, I am not completely sure if some scenes may trigger this again. But don't worry, because Pure Writer for Android supports multiple Backups. You can recover/restore it by using "History" or "Undo". More about automatic backup and cloud backup: https://writer.drakeet.com/backups
