### Pure Writer Desktop



> Pure Writer Writer Desktop itself is completely FREE and **open-source**. **It is currently very basic**, providing only two-directions real-time synchronous editing for your current article, even it may not work for you at all ⚠️⚠️⚠️. **If you are going to pay _JUST_ for this Desktop, I strongly recommend that you reconsider it.**

This is the first alpha version of Pure Writer Desktop, which is designed and developed by me just like [Pure Writer for Android](https://writer.drakeet.com). It is very difficult to develop this desktop version. At present, it is still very basic. It can only provide basic real-time connection and synchronous editing. If you encounter dissatisfaction or problems during use, please understand and wait for its subsequent updates.

#### Open Source

Pure Writer Desktop is open source: https://github.com/PureWriter/desktop

#### So far, Pure Writer Desktop has some known issues, please be sure to read them all:

- The path to store Pure Writer Desktop **cannot contain non-English characters**, otherwise it will not work properly

- Pure Writer Desktop 0.2 version, which must be used with Pure Writer 17.7.10 or above

- Pure Writer Desktop must be **on the same Wi-Fi or hotspot network** as the phone to connect to each other

- During the development of this version 0.3.1, I have encountered some situations that will cause the current article on Pure Writer Android to be emptied. Although this problem has been fixed, I am not completely sure if some scenes may trigger this again. But don't worry, if you get this type of problem, please don't panic because Pure Writer for Android supports multiple Documents/PureWriter/Backups and measures to prevent loss. If you encounter an error, you can recover/restore it by using "History" or "Undo" in the top right corner.

- Pure Writer version 0.3.1 does not support automatic indentation when adding new line breaks, which will be supported later. Now you can ignore the indentation. After the article is finished, open the "Formatters" in the top right corner of Pure Writer Android. The tool can automatically insert the indent at the beginning of every paragraph.

- Pure Writer version 0.3.1 does not support editing titles on your computer

- When modifying the current article title on the phone, it will not be synced to the desktop version in real-time. After you modify the body content, the title will be sent to the computer along with the text for simultaneous display. This issue will be fixed in a later release.

- Currently, you need to ensure that Pure Writer Android is not killed by the system in the background, otherwise, it will be disconnected and cannot continue editing the current article. This will be resolved later.

- For the macOS version, since I don't currently have an **Apple Developer account**, I can't sign the app. If your system has a network firewall enabled, the mac system will ask the user whether it is allowed to access the network each time. Click Allow, please. This will be resolved later, or if you know how to solve this problem as soon as possible, you can contact me, thank you!

- emoji is currently not displayed properly

- The macOS version does not support third-party input method punctuation. Please use the native input method.

- **When switching chapters, the Android client may receive the wrong sync message. Please pay attention to the contents of both ends when switching chapters. If you find something is wrong, restore it in time or restore it through History.**

(I wrote this article twice, the first time is written directly in the edit box on GitHub, it may be that I accidentally triggered the return button, so when I finally wrote it, it was completely lost. QAQ, very distressed, I didn't expect that I also had this day, and it happened at this moment, it was too dramatic! So I opened Pure Writer Desktop and rewritten this article again on Pure Writer Desktop from beginning to end. Great, it didn't have any problems, with the peace of mind writing experience, feeling awesome ^ ^)
